# FalkirkBinAlert

## Falkirk *put yer bins out* alerter.

All too frequently I forget to put my bins out, and these days given the length of time between bin collection that's not a good thing.

This is my solution, a wee app that sits in the Windows system tray and nags you to put the bins out the evening before thay are due. It also shows when the next collection day is for each colour of bin.

## Installation

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Aspallar/FalkirkBinAlert/releases) and download the **FalkirkBinsInstaller.msi** file from the latest release. Once it's downloaded double click on the downloaded file or right click on it and choose "Install".

## Prerequisites

You need the following to be able to run FalkirkBinAlerter

* **Windows 7 or later**
* **.Net Framework 4.7.2** *this is probably already installed on your PC.*
